# Hi! I am DÃ©bora Zuanny âœ¨ 

Welcome to my GitHub! I am deeply interested in how distribution of plants reflects history and evolution, and what are the major factors that can change the taxonomy and biogeography of mega-diverse genera over time. Whilst much of my work reflect a continuing engagement with R community, here I show custom scripts and I look to collaborate on open source initiatives!
